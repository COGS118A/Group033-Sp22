    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

    "# Abstract \n",
    "We want to make a model that can recommend the best drug a patient can get for their condition. To make this model we are using data from the UCI ML Drug Review dataset which displays thousands of observations of patients’ reviews and ratings of certain drugs along side what condition they took the drug for and how many users found their review useful. To achieve our goal, we will first clean up our data primarily the review section and the date to make them more readable then implement a classification algorithm such as decision trees or K-nearest Neighbors to determine the best drug that should be used for certain conditions. To test the performance of our model we will split the data into a train and test group and compare the two."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Prescribing the proper drug to use for any given condition or circumstance is one of the most important aspects of being a physician<a name=\"rational\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#rationalnote). For any given disease that requires treatment, there may be thousands of drug options and potentially infinite variation in the patients which makes reaching a decision about a prescribed drug and treatment plan a cognitively difficult task. Even then, once a drug is prescribed, it could have negative effects for the patient that could prove just as troublesome as the original problem. Rational prescribing refers to the methodology physicians use when choosing what drug to prescribe (diagnosing, assessing prognosis and patient goals, establishing treatment plan, and monitoring the treatment)<a name=\"rational\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#rationalnote). Finding a model that would optimize patient care and increase patient satisfaction would be beneficial for not just the patients, but also the physicians who monitor the treatment plan. It could also potentially lead to a standardization of rational prescribing for physicians globally.\n",
    "   \n",
    "WHO estimates that more than half of the drugs prescribed, are prescribed inappropriately to the patient meaning that the drug prescribed was not the best possible choice for the patient<a name=\"who\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#whonote). It is a global issue that has created excessive waste of scarce resources and in some cases has contributed to wide-spread health hazards. An example would be the overuse of injections when oral formulations would be considered more appropriate for the situation<a name=\"who\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#whonote). Using a model that captures the process of rational prescription could reduce the number of inappropriate prescriptions which could potentially lead to more resources and reduce the likelihood of health hazards.\n",
    "    \n",
    "This model could also potentially help physicians who are “pathologically prescribing”. A study that randomly sampled from registered medical practitioners showed that more than 60% of prescription antibiotics were prescribed without enough indication to do so as well as a lesser duration period than would be effective for treatment<a name=\"irrational\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#irrationalnote). As humans, we eventually become desensitized and habituated to our environments after prolonged exposure. What this means for physicians or registered medical practitioners is that eventually one might see symptoms that are common with certain diseases and think that the common prescription for that disease may be substantial. However, each patient is different and there could perhaps be slight differences that physicians miss. A model that could distinguish between those differences and help physicians make more appropriate choices for the specific patient rather than the general circumstances usually associated with the problem could be beneficial for both patient and physician."
