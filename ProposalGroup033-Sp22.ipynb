    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",

    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

    "We want to make a model that can recommend the best drug a patient can get for their condition. To make this model we are using data from the UCI ML Drug Review dataset which displays thousands of observations of patients’ reviews and ratings of certain drugs along side what condition they took the drug for and how many users found their review useful. To achieve our goal, we will first clean up our data primarily the review section and the date to make them more readable then implement a classification algorithm such as decision trees or K-nearest Neighbors to determine the best drug that should be used for certain conditions. To test the performance of our model we will split the data into a train and test group and compare the two."
